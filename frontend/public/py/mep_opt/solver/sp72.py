IRC:SP:72-2015 — Low-Volume Rural Road Design Branch
====================================================
For design traffic up to 2 million cumulative ESAL (~2 MSA), IRC:37 hands
off to IRC:SP:72, a catalogue-based method for low-volume rural roads.

This module provides the SP:72 *classification and rule* layer:
  - cumulative ESAL computation (same growth-series as IRC:37 traffic),
  - traffic categorisation T1..T9,
  - subgrade strength classification S1..S5 (from CBR),
  - regime detection (is this an SP:72 job?),
  - the SP:72 composition rules the optimizer must honour below 2 MSA.

The mechanistic IITPAVE engine still verifies the design; SP:72 changes the
*framing and constraints* (thin bituminous surfacing, coarser thickness
increments, blacktop-only above 100k ESAL, minimum base thickness).

for Low Volume Rural Roads (First Revision)", §3 (Traffic), §8 (Recommended
Designs), Figs. 4 & 6.
